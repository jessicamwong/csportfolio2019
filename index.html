       <p style="width:70%"> Hi! My name is Jessica and I am currently a high school student
       at Summit Shasta. I was born in San Francisco, but I grew up in South San Franciso. I 
       have an older sister named Marisa and a younger brother named Dylan. Some activities 
       that I enjoy doing in my free time are exercising, stretching, watching youtube, and 
       crafting. I love to travel to different places and explore, though, I have not visited 
       many places so far. Unlike some others, I like to have a busy schedule and be involved 
       with extracurriculars. I started playing volleyball at the end of 6th grade and I still 
       currently play. I also started playing soccer in 9th grade for the Shasta Girl's Soccer
       team. These are two sports that I like doing for fun and also keep me busy after school. </p>

  <h2 id="program" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 525px;">Intro to Programming</h2>
  
  <div id="center">
     <p style="width:90%">Throughout my Intro to Programming class, I am learning how to code 
     using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Since I've never been exposed to coding, all of this 
     information is new to me. The first thing that I learned was the HTML basics. This covered
     a variety of tags such as the following:</p>
  </div>
  <div id="center" class="row-container">
  
  <div style="text-align:left">
    <ul id="tag">
       <li> body </li>
       <li> p </li>
       <li> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 </li>
       <li> br </li>
       <li> ol/ul </li>
       <li> em </li>
       <li> img </li>
       <li> table </li>
       <li> tr </li>
       <li> td </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
   <img src="http://vfxmotion.ir/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kartinka22.jpg" style="width:35%">
  </div>
  <div id="center">
     <p style="width:95%">These tags allow me to create a multitide of things, including web pages, such
     as the one you are looking at right now. Before I took the class, I always thought that coding was 
     boring. However, I soon learned that coding was actually really fun and cool. I never knew how much 
     you can do when you just play around with the code. Though, coding can be quite hard and frustrating
     at times. Sometimes I would forget to add an end tag or maybe mispell a tag and it would take me a 
     really long time to figure out why certain content wasn't appearing on my web page. I would stare at
     my code for hours or try to edit parts of it to see if it would change anything. This process would
     repeat until I figured out what was wrong. Through this process, I learned patience and precision. 
     Patience is important when coding because it can be a very tedious process at times. Precision is 
     also super important because one small mistake, such as forgetting to add a semi colon or mispelling
     a tag, can mess up your whole code.</p>
