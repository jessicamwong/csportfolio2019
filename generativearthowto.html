        <div style="text-align:center">
            <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;">What I Created</h2>

            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> For this project, I created a webpage of a scene with two owls
            perched on a branch and stars using functions, loops, and conditionals. The stars (made with ellipses) were 
            constantly changing sizes, and the owls' eyes changed color when the screen was clicked. When the mouse clicked 
            the screen on the left side, the eyes of the owl on the left side changed color. The same thing happened with 
            the owl on the right when the right side of the screen was clicked. Though, the ellipse were constantly changing
            size and position. I created this page to convey the idea of adventure. This is because I really enjoy being out
            in nature and going on adventures. Therefore, I used my webpage to in a way, portray a little bit of who I am as
            a person.
            </p>

            <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px; "> How the Project Works Overall</h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%">In order to create my webpage, I had to use a variety of functions,
            conditionals, and loops. These were all really important to use when coding because they were what created the 
            images/objects that appeared on the webpage and allowed them to move or change a certain way.
            </p>


            <h3 id="center4" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 400px;">Specifics of the Code</h3>

            <h4><strong><em>Functions</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> Functions were really important when creating my webpage because
            they made up a big portion of my project. They were what allowed me to create the owls, tree branches, and stars
            that are seen on my page. In order to create the owls and the stars, I used the ellipse function which is formatted
            like this when coded: <br>
                <font size="+3">ellipse(_, _, _, _);</font> <br> The first two values control where on the canvas/webpage the 
                ellipse shows up. The first one moves the ellipse left and right while the second one moves the ellipse up and 
                down. The last two values control the length and width of the ellipse. The first value controls the width and
                the second value controls the height of the ellipse. Here is an example of how I coded one of my owls:
            </p>
            <img style="width:375px" src="images/owlcode.png" />
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%">Here is how the code appeared on my webpage: </p>
            <img src="images/owl.png" />
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> A similar code was used to create my second owl on my webpage, 
            though the values were slightly different.</p>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> However, I also created my own function, which I named "owl". All of
            the code used to create the owls were placed inside this function. This allowed all of the code within this function 
            to run when the fuction was called, or defined. This is how my owl function looked when coded:
            </p>
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/owlfunction.png"/>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> This is an example of how I defined, or called, my owl function:
            </p>
            <img style="width:250px" src="images/calledowlcode.png"/>
            <h4><strong><em>Loops</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%"> In addition to functions, I used loops. Specifically, I used "for loops"
            which allowed my block of code to run over and over again. I used these loops for my stars, which is why they are 
            constantly changing positions and size. Since I wanted the circles to be different sizes and in a different position
            each time, I coded it so that the height, width, and size was random each time. This is how the code for the stars/ellipses
            looked and how it appeared on my webpage:
            </p>
            <img src="images/forloopcode.png" /> <br>
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/forloopstarsone.png" />
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/forloopstarstwo.png" />
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%"> As you can see in the pictures depicting my webpage, because the height, 
            width, and size were set to random, the circles were in different positions and had different sizes each time.
            </p>

            <h4><strong><em>Conditionals</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> The last part of my code that I used while creating my webpage was the if/else
            statement. These made it so that when the mouse was clicked on the left side of the webpage, the owl's eyes on the left side
            of the page changed color and when the mouse was clicked on the right side of the webpage, the owl's eyes on the right side 
            of the page would change color. The "if" statement for my webpage meant that if the mouse was clicked on the left side on my 
            screen, the eyes of the owl who was on the left side would change color. In order to make this possible, I had to make the 
            mousex (which controlled the width of the page) to be smaller than a certain value to ensure it was of the left side.
            </p>
            <img src="images/conditionalcode.png" /> <br>
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/pinkeyeowl.png" />
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/blueeyeowl.png" />
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> As you can see, because the screen was clicked on the left side of my 
            page, the eyes of the owl eyes of the owl changed to different colors, while the eye color of the owl on the right side
            remained the same.
            </p>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> The second part of the conditional is the "else" statement, which says that
            if the statement is false, run the code under the else statement as the alternative. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/elsecode.png"/> <br>
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/purpleeyeowl.png"/>
            <img style="width:350px" src="images/greeneyeowl.png"/>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> Since the else statement was the alternative code if the if statement was false,
            when the screen was clicked on the right side of the canvas, the eye color of the owl on the right side changed instead.
                
            </p> 

            <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> Coding Choices and Decisions</h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> While coding my webpage, I had to make many choices including colors, 
            patterns, and placement of objects. However, the biggest decision that I had to make was deciding what I was going to 
            include on my webpage and the scene that I was going to portray. I started off by thinking of potential scenes that 
            I can create. I also thought of ways I could include loops, functions, and conditionals in each of the scenes while
            also making it interactive for the user. I knew that I wanted the color of an object to change color when a user clicked
            on the screen. I also knew that I wanted something moving or changing in the background. That is how I decided on creating
            my final product with the owls and the stars. </p>
            <h4><strong><em>Limitations</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%">One problem that I faced was coding the ellipse function (that created the stars)
            to do what I wanted. I wanted the size and placement of the ellipses to constantly change. Therefore, I put I used the for
            loop. In the beginning, I was only able to create my webpage so that the sizes of the ellipses were different or the ellipses 
            were the same size and blinking. None of these ways that I tried had the ellipses constantly changing position and changing 
            size at the same time. This was a limitation for me because the majority of the times that I tried to get the ellipses to look
            like how I wanted them to look did not work out. This meant that I had to take multiple approaches to solving the problem. As
            I looked at my code, I realized that a potential solution would be to make it so that the height and the width of the ellipse
            was random. Doing so, I was able to fix my problem and get the stars to do what I wanted.
            </p>

            <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> How My Perspective Has Changed </h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%">My perspective over the duration of this project has changed because in the
            beginning, I thought that it would be really difficult to find a way to incorporate loops, conditionals, and functions in
            my webpage. Though, was I began to create my webpage, I learned that I just have to be creative and remember what each part
            did. This made it a lot easier for me to think of ways to include all three tools. Going into this project, I also thought 
            that coding my webpage would be a lot easier. However, as I began running into problems, I learned that the order and 
            placement of my code really mattered and can really change the outcome of the webpage.
            </p>

            <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> What I Would Change </h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:74%"> Although I got was able to create the majority of my webpage to look the 
            way I wanted and do the things I wanted it to do, there were also specific elements that I would have wanted to include
            and slightly alter. First off, although I think that the owls look good, I would have wanted to make the eyes a little 
            bit bigger. In addition, I created the owls to be on tree branch, but as you can see on my webpage, there are no trees
            and only the branches. If I had more time to work on my webpage and improve it, I would have wanted to make trees like
            I had envisioned.
