        <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;">What I Created</h2>

        <div>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">For this project, I created an "About Me" page. This 
            included a brief introduction about who I am and some of my interests, followed by a few 
            fun facts about myself and a description about my Intro to Programming class. For my 
            "Introduction" section, I covered some general information about my family and where I 
            grew up, as well as some hobbies and activities that I enjoy doing. In my "Intro to 
            Programming" section, I discussed some of the main things that I had learned from the
            class. I also put a couple of pictures on my page and added a background image to make my
            page look nicer. You may notice that I also have a navigation bar at the top of my webpage that
            allows users to view other projects that I created. I will continue to add to the navigation 
            bar so that this webpage can serve as a collection or portfolio of my programming projects.</p>

         <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px; "> How the Project Works Overall</h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">I created my webpage by piecing together different parts
            of code to create one cohesive page. I used a variety of tags to code my webpage, such as 
            headers/headings, body tags, paragraph tags, and list tags. Tags are the specific elements of the code that
            define what content goes onto the webpage. This includes text, images, placement, etc. </p>

         <h3 id="center4" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 400px;">Specifics of the Code</h3>
          <h4><strong><em>Headings</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">One of the main tags that I used for my "About Me" page was 
            the heading tag <code>(&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;) </code>. This tag created all of the headings on my page such as the About Me,
            Introduction, Fun Facts, and Intro to Programming headings. There are <strong>six</strong> different heading tags
            (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) which determine the size of the heading. The <strong>h1 tag creates the largest 
            heading</strong> while the <strong>h6 tag creates the smallest heading</strong>. For my about me page, I used the h1 tag 
            to create the "About Me" heading because it is the main topic of my webpage. In order to create
            this tag, I used an <strong>opening and closing angle bracket</strong> with the h1 in between. You can think of these angle brackets 
            as the greater than and less than symbols. I then created an end tag, which is almost the same as an opening tag, except there is a forward slash before the h1.
            Finally, I put "About Me" in between the opening and closing tag. I used the same process to create
            the rest of my headings on my page, except, I used the h2 heading tag for both my "Introduction" and
            "Intro to Programming" headings because they are different sections on my page. The h3 heading tag
            was used to create the "Fun Facts" heading because it is a sub-category of my introduction. If you
            look at the image above, of my webpage, you will notice the difference in sizing of my headings. 
            Here are examples of my code for the headings:</p>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/aboutmeheading"/>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/introductionheading"/>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/funfactsheading"/>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/introtpheading"/>
          
         <h4><strong><em>Paragraphs</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">Another tag that was used frequently when coding my "About Me" page
            was the paragraph tag, or the "p" tag. This tag was used to create <strong>all of the big chunks of text that
            you see on the page</strong>. A similar process was used to create the paragraph tags, except, I put a "p" in 
            between the opening and closing angle bracket. Therefore it looks something like this: <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
            I put all the content that I wanted on my page within the opening and closing p tag. Here is an example
            of what the code looks like for one of the paragraphs on my page and how it looks on my About Me webpage:</p>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/paragraphcodeimg"/>
             <img style="border: 2px solid black" src="https://tinyurl.com/paragrphimg"/>
        
         <h4><strong><em>Lists</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">Additionally, I used the list tag to create all of the lists that you
            see on the page, like the fun facts list and the list of the tags. There are two types of lists: ordered
            and unordered. An ordered list looks something like how the "Fun Facts" list is organized. An <strong>ordered list
            creates numbers for each list item</strong>. In order to create an ordered list, you have to use the ordered list 
            tag which looks like this: <code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code>. The "ol" stands for ordered list. You may 
            notice that all tags are created the same way, with an opening and closing angle bracket sandwiching the 
            element. To begin the actual list, however, you have to create list tags and have them nested within the
            ordered tags. List tags look like this: <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>. Here is how the code looks for
            my Fun Facts list and how it appeared on my webpage:</p>
             <img src="https://tinyurl.com/listimg"/>
             <img style="border: 2px solid black" src="https://tinyurl.com/funfactslist"/>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">An unordered list tag contains "ul" inside of the angle
            brackets and look like this: <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>. The difference between an ordered and 
            unordered list is that an <strong>unordered list only bullet points out the list items</strong> instead of numbering each list
            item. An example of an unordered list would be the list of the tags on my page. The process for creating an
            unordered list is similar to the process for creating an ordered list, as I had to create list tags and have
            them nested inside the unordered list tags. Here is the the code that I created for my tag list and how it 
            looks on my webpage:</p>
            <img src="https://tinyurl.com/ullistimg"/>
            <img style="border: 2px solid black" src="https://tinyurl.com/wplistimg"/>
        
          <h4><strong><em>Background Images and Colors</em></strong></h4>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">You may notice that my About Me webpage is colorful and has a background 
            image. This was possible because of the background element I inputed in my CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS 
            allows me to style my webpage a certain way. Coding in CSS is difference from coding in Html because with CSS,
            you do not input tags. In order to change the background of something on my webpage, I used the background 
            element. Since I wanted to change the background of my webpage to an image, I specifically used the 
            <strong>background-image</strong> element. You can see the rose background image on both my About Me webpage as well
            as the webpage you are currently looking at. Here is the code that I used for my background image:</p>
            <img src="https://tinyurl.com/bkgrdimg"/>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">I also decided to change the background color of my headings to make them 
            stand out more. In order to do so, I had to once again, use the background element. Though, this time, I 
            specifically used the <strong>background-color</strong> element instead of the background-image element because
            I wanted the heading backgrounds to be a color and not an image. I then inputed the number that corresponded 
            with the color that I wanted. I also had to specify that I wanted the background color for the headings and 
            not the whole website. Therefore, I put whichever heading element that I used for my page (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) 
            before I put the background image element. Here is an example of how  I coded my "About Me" heading to have a 
            background color:</p>
            <img src="https://tinyurl.com/headingcss"/>
        
         <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> Coding Choices and Decisions</h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">While coding my About Me page, I had to make many choices. The majority were
            about the formatting and organization of my webpage. This was due to the fact that the content that appeared 
            on my screen did not always look that way I wanted it to. For example, when I first began creating my page, I started by 
            coding the headings and paragraphs. However the code <em>only</em> showed up on the webpage as it was designed to do. This
            meant that none of the content was centered or formatted a certain way. This was a limitation that I faced in my code because
            I had to separately code specific elements into my CSS. Since I wanted to center my whole page, I would normally use the
            "text-align: center" element. However, this function did not always work and therefore, was another limitation and stuggle 
            that I encountered throughout the coding process. Since this function did not always work, I used margins to center my content. 
            Here is an example of how I centered the information on webpage:</p>
            <img src="https://tinyurl.com/centerimg"/>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">Another decision I had to make was determining the size of each heading. You can
            see that my About Me page has headings of different sizes, with the "About Me" heading being the biggest and the "Fun Facts" 
            heading being the smallest. The reason behind these differences is that I wanted to correlate the heading size with importance. 
            The "About Me" heading is the largest on my page because it is the most important, as that is the main topic of my page. The 
            "Introduction" and "Intro to Programming" headings are still fairly large, but smaller than the "About Me" heading because they
            are still important, but are sections of my page that do not define the main point of my page. Lastly, the "Fun Facts" heading 
            is the smallest because it is a subsection of my introduction, so it is not too important. If you want more details and a closer 
            look at how my headings were coded, you can go to the "Headings" subsection under the "Specifics of the Code" heading.</p>
        
         <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> How My Perspective Has Changed </h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">This project has greatly changed both my connection and understanding of HTML 
            and CSS. I had never been exposed to coding prior to this project, so I always thought that it was really boring.
            I never thought about or realized how much you can create with code and, therefore, this project taught me <em>a lot</em>. 
            This project showed me that coding can actually be really fun and is definitely not boring like I initially thought it would
            be. I enjoyed creating my own webpage and having the freedom to choose how my webpage looked and how it was formatted. 
            Though, coding is still a lot of work and is difficult and frustrating at times. </p>
        
         <h2 class="centerheadings" style="border: 2px solid black; width: 500px;"> What I Would Change </h2>
            <p class="centerparagraphs" style="width:72%">Some aspects of my website that I would change if I had more time 
            would be to include some interactive elements where the users can actually play around with my webpage. I would also 
            potentially add a couple more images to clarify and explain more about myself. </p>
